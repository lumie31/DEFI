# CREATE AND DEPLOY A DEFI APP

## Introduction

Create and deploy a DeFi App to Ethereum

## Motivation

Build a DeFi Application with Solidity where users can deposit an ERC20 token to the smart contract and it will mint and transfer Farm Tokens to them. The users can later withdraw their ERC20 tokens by burning their Farm Token on smart contract and the ERC20 tokens will be transferred back to them.
